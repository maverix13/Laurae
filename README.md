# What is inside?

| Function Name | Type | What is it for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| tsne_grid | Dimensionality Reduction + Grid Search | Allows to grid search a seed and a perplexity interval using t-SNE, while returning the best t-SNE model along with the best iteration found, all in a fully verbose fashion. |

To add:

* xgboost grid search
* xgboost unbalanced large dataset learning
* large sparse matrix loader
* Categorical to Numeric converter: h2o's autoencoder, mxnet's autoencoder, t-SNE, Generalized Low Rank Models, largeVis, FeatureHashing - along with testing performance using xgboost
* Rule search
* Logloss brute force calibration
* Prediction Analyzer (analyze any type of model predictions, currently only binary)
* Automated Feature Creator (create automatically features using linear (^1), quadratic (^2), cubic (^3), quartic (^4), mean, and standard deviation of different random features as inputs) - all with a GUI to interrupt without losing data with full verbosity of search
* Automated Feature Analyzer (analyze created features and test against randomness of improval) - all with verbosity
* Leave-one-out encoding (encodes any categorical using a continuous variable such as the label or a feature)
* AND MANY MORE...
